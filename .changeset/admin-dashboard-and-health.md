Add an admin dashboard (`/admin`, replacing the old redirect to the create form) showing piece/asset stats, recently-edited pieces, and setup status, plus an `/admin/health` page with live checks (storage, worker, auth issuer, archive/cdn sync, AI key) that can each be re-run on demand. Archive/cdn checks run through a new `TestConnectivity` worker workflow since the web app has no rclone binary or credentials of its own.
