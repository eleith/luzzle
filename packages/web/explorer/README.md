# Luzzle Web Explorer

The official web viewer for Luzzle archives, built with SvelteKit.

## Overview

Luzzle Web Explorer is a beautiful, fast, and responsive web application for
browsing your personal archive. It connects to your Luzzle data to display your
books, films, writings, and more in a rich interface.

## Usage

The recommended way to run the Web Explorer is via Docker.

### Quick Start (Docker)

You can build a custom image that includes your configuration and content.

1. Create a `Dockerfile` based on the example in `examples/Dockerfile.custom`.
2. Build and run:

```bash
docker build -t my-luzzle-explorer .
docker run -p 3000:3000 my-luzzle-explorer
```

## Key Features

* **Fast & Responsive:** Built on SvelteKit for optimal performance.
* **Rich Media:** Displays optimized images and open graph tags (generated by
    Web Tools).
* **Themable:** Configurable appearance via `config.yaml`.

## Configuration

The Web Explorer is configured using a `config.yaml` file. This file controls
various aspects of the site, including URLs, text content, database paths, and
theming.

**Key Sections:**

* **url:** Defines application URLs (e.g., `app`, `app_assets`).
* **text:** Site title and description.
* **paths:** Locations for the `database` and `config` files.
* **content:** Settings for content roots and feeds.
* **pieces:** Defines how different piece types (like `book` or `film`) are
displayed, including their components and field mappings.
* **theme:** A comprehensive theming system allowing detailed control over
colors (light/dark modes), global styles (fonts, spacing, radius), and markdown
rendering specific settings (like code block themes).
