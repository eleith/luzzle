# Agents.md for @luzzle/web

This document provides guidance for developers and AI assistants working on the
@luzzle/web package (Luzzle Web Explorer).

## Guiding Principles

The Luzzle Web Explorer is the primary presentation layer for a Luzzle archive.
It is designed to be a read-only viewer that presents the user's content in a
visually rich and navigable format, typically deployed via Docker.

## Architecture

This is a SvelteKit application.

- **Config:** the website is configured through `config.yaml`. the configuration
  is managed by `@luzzle/web.tools` and it controls theme, location of the luzzle
  web database, and a mapping of desired luzzle pieces to pieces that are shows on
  the web explorer as well as a mapping of piece fields to web piece fields (ex:
  image, title, summary, tags)
- **Data Source:** It reads from the derived SQLite database (generated by by
  `@luzzle/web.tools`)
- **Rendering:** Uses Server-Side Rendering (SSR) via `@sveltejs/adapter-node`.
  generation).

## Key Concepts

- **Docker Deployment:** The primary consumption model. Users need to build
  custom images using `examples/Dockerfile.custom` to bundle their content and
  customize their explorer preferences
- **Read-Only:** This app does not modify the archive. It strictly reads the
  data.
- **Database:** the database is a superset of the original one produced by
  `@luzzle/core`. `@luzzle/web.tools` adds a web pieces table to aggregate all
  piece types into one table as well as a FTS table to enable searching on the
  web.

## Development

- **Dev Server:** `npm run dev`
- **Build:** `npm run build`
- **Check:** `npm run check`
